# Connect-Delegate365

## Synopsis
Connects to the API in Delegate365.

## Description
Connect-Delegate365 connects to the API in Delegate365.
Use this command to connect to your Delegate365 tenant at the beginning of any PowerShell commands or scripts.
This command requires a WebApiBaseUrl and a WebApiSasKey parameter.
The WebApiBaseUrl is the URI of your Delegate365 tenant, as https://[mycompany].delegate365.com.
The WebApiSasKey must be provided by your Delegate365 Portal Admin. It's a key that identifies your admin account and is specific for your use.
The key is a string as "123456..". Keep this key well and do not hand it over to other persons, it's your personal access to the API.
As output, an informational string is returned. If no error occurs, it should respond with "successfully connected" within some seconds.
After a successful connection is established, you can start working with the Delegate365 cmdlets. 
Afterwards, use Disconnect-Delegate365 to close the connection.
